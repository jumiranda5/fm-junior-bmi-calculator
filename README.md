### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9004307/two-input-fields-inside-one-label) - When I saw the design files, it looked like the fields for the imperial units were wrapped in one label, but I didn't know if it was right to use one label for two fields. The accepted answer cleared that to me. 
- [w3schools Accessibility Labels](https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/accessibility_labels.php) - This w3schools page is very good to understand labels and legends.
- [MDN docs - input type="number"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#accessibility_concerns) - I was going to set the inputs type to number, but since I didn't want the role to be "spinbutton", I followed the MDN docs and replaced it with type="text" and inputmode="numeric".
